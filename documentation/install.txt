INSTALLATION

This version of the code is written to be compiled with Intel Fortran Compiler (IFC) 8.1, at the moment
the latest one downloadable from www.intel.com. It should compile under IFC 8.0 likely with some 
minor tweak to the compiler options. Minor changes to the codes are instead required for it to compile 
under IFC 7.*. We can provide you a suitable version should you need it: simply contact us.
IFC can be downloaded free of charge for research applications under Linux (go on www.intel.com, products 
and services, software, compilers, fortran compiler for linux, free evaluation download, and choose 
"noncommercial unsupported version"). Please refer to the "End User Licence Agreement" page there for details 
about IFC licensing issues. IFC is a beautiful and powerful software, offered free of charge with a complete, 
massive documentation: we are extremely grateful to Intel to providing it for research purposes. As it is, 
the code comes equipped with a complete set of linelists and BIG type ODF, appropriate for model calculation . 
It comes also with a set of template execution script, and a set of tutorials. Check the website for updates to the
documentation, since it is evolving.

The tarballs available at the moment are (I omit the.tar.bz2 extension):

src -> Sources of Kurucz codes. 
lines -> Linelists for Synthe
lines_at12 -> Lines for Atlas 12. Beware: this one is HUGE. Unless you plan to use Atlas 12, leave it.
odf -> Opacities for Atlas 9
scripts -> Installation scripts, and some example scripts. 
bin -> precompiled binaries. 
utilities -> Useful programs of many kinds. 
molecules -> Molecular lines for Synthe.
doc -> (Hopefully) up-to-date documentation, including a complete offline version of the web site.

The installation scheme we suggest (and the one for which all the scripts and examples are written) is the following:

1) become root and create a directory /usr/local/kurucz. You will have to stay root for all the installation.

2) put there the tarballs

3) decompress each one of them by saying:

    tar -xvjf FILENAME.tar.bz2
    

Each tarball becomes a directory with the same name. 

4) If you choose (or have) to recompile the sources, you should have IFC 8.1 installed. The source files
to be compiled are in the src/ and utilities/ directories. Firt of all, check if the Intel Compiler
is in the right place, looking to the location of the file "ifort" (for a typical install it is 
/opt/intel_fc_80/bin/ifort), and check if it correspondt to what is written in the line

FC = . /opt/intel_fc_80/bin/ifort

at the beginning of the Makefile in src/ or in utilities/. If it does not, edit the Makefile (both) accordingly.

5) when this is done, simply do

make all

inside src/ and utilities/. Do not worry if it takes time.

6) If this works (do not worry about warnings), you are done.
